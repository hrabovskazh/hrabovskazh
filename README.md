### Hi there 👋 I'm Yevheniia!
I am a PhD in Finance from Stockholm School of Economics. I have 3+ years of experience working with large datasets (registry data) but due to sensitive nature of the data, cannot display large part of the work here. Instead, here I use public datasets to present my skills in programming, data analysis, causal analysis, etc. 

- 🎨Interests: financial literacy, wealth management, health economics, fashion industry, war in Ukraine.
- 📫 How to reach me: hrabovska.yevheniia@gmail.com
