### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Yevheniia!
I am a PhD Candidate in Finance at Stockholm School of Economics. Finishing the program in summer 2022 and open to work in Stockholm (and remotely in Europe). I have 3+ years of experience working with large datasets (registry data) but due to sensitive nature of the data, cannot display large part of the work here. Instead, here I use public datasets to present my skills in programming, data analysis, causal analysis, etc. 

- ðŸŽ¨Interests: financial literacy, wealth management, health economics, fashion industry, war in Ukraine.

# Projects

## Russian invasion of Ukraine. Data visualization in R

( [code](https://github.com/hrabovskazh) | [slides](https://github.com/hrabovskazh) )

I use the Kaggle dataset ([Ukraine Russia War](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/piterfm/2022-ukraine-russian-war)) recording Equipment Losses & Death Toll & Military Wounded & Prisoner of War of russians since 24.02.2022.

Plotting dynamics of equipment losses by type (e.g. aircrafts, tanks, drones, etc.) reveals the change in character of fighting prior to russian withdrawal from the Northern front (Kyiv, Sumy, Chernihiv).

**Skills:** data cleaning, R coding, data visualization.

**Tools:** RStudio, dplyr, ggplot2, PowerPoint.

My notes and solutions for Udemy course in R basics and data visualization.
The course provides a good refresher on R's core principles, advantages of vectorized operation and data visualization techniques using ggplot2.
